## Biography

Currently, I'm a master's student in the EECS department at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Currently, I'm advised by Prof.[Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/) in the University of Michigan and I'm working closely with Prof.[Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) Zhejiang University I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and my bachelor's degree in Finance from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). And I'm also a member of [CKC Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/). During my undergraduate, I was advised by Prof.[Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) of ZJU and Prof.[Xiaobin Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018064) in the [College of Economy](http://www.cec.zju.edu.cn/cecen/main.psp) of ZJU. 

My current research interests are `Trustworthy AI`/`AI for Science` currently.

## Research
### `Unified Fair Federated Learning for Digital Healthcare`

- Timeline: May 2023-Aug 2023
- Institution: Institute of Artificial Intelligence, ZJU
- Instructor: [prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/)
-	Motivation: To ensure fairness in federated learning with healthcare institutions, we employ distributionally robust optimization to achieve consistent and high-performing federated models among diverse demographics.
-	Contribution: presents a unified framework encompassing various fairness metrics in federated learning and devises an efficient and collaborative machine learning procedure for its implementation.
-	Product: A paper published in Cell Press Pattern 2023, co-first author.

### `Continual Domain Generalization`

- Timeline: Aug 2022-Jan 2023
- Institution: Institute of Artificial Intelligence, ZJU
- Instructor: [prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/)
-	Motivation: Tackle the challenging problem of deploying the Domain Generalization model in the continual data stream.
-	Method: Learn domain invariance from the data stream by fusing the new and old knowledge flexibly in a contrastive support space. Specifically, train a prior-optimized variational auto-encoder using a reconstruction loss to initialize a semantic preservation latent space; adopt contrastive learning to construct a contrastive support space, which is used to obtain exemplar data as memory to overcome the forgetting problem during stream training.
-	Contribution: Propose a new task and provide a novel method to solve this problem.
-	Product: A NIPS 2023 submitted paper, 1st author.

### `Internet Comments (nudge)’s Influence on Individuals’ High-level Thinking`

- Timeline: May-Sept 2022
- Institution: CSC Lab, UC Davis
- Instructor: [prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/)
-	Motivation: Investigate if peers' thinking comments can help nudge individuals on higher-order thinking processes.
-	Method: Complete user experiments on the well-designed prototypes based on our assumptions.
-	Role: Implement the Deep Thinking Map prototype based on the Concept Map developed in our lab; help organize pilot experiments; literature surveying


### `Spatio-temporal Data Compression`

- Timeline: Jul-Sept 2021
- Institution: Center of Data Science, ZJU
-	Motivation: Solve the spatiotemporal data compression problem with the techniques for graph evolution.
-	Method: Combine a particle-swarm-optimization-based graph clustering algorithm and a compression algorithm (a well-designed data structure ) for dynamic-evolution spatiotemporal data.
-	Role: reproduce two baseline papers with C++ codes and run several large-scale datasets to conduct the case study.
