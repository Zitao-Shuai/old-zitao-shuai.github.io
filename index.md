## Biography

Currently, I'm a senior student of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) majored in Computer Science while minored in Finance. And I'm also a member of [CKC Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/). I'll get my Bachelor degree in the [Department of computer science and technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at Zhejiang University advised by [prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/). 
My current research interests are `OOD` / `Domain generalization` / `Explainable AI` / `Causal Learning` / `Human centered AI` currently. 

## Research

### `Continual Domain Generalization`

- Timeline: Aug 2022-Jan 2023
- Institution: Institute of Artificial Intelligence, ZJU
- Instructor: [prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/)
-	Motivation: Tackle the challenging problem of deploying the Domain Generalization model in the continual data stream.
-	Method: Learn domain invariance from the data stream by fusing the new and old knowledge flexibly in a contrastive support space. Specifically, train a prior-optimized variational auto-encoder using a reconstruction loss to initialize a semantic preservation latent space; adopt contrastive learning to construct a contrastive support space, which is used to obtain exemplar data as memory to overcome the forgetting problem during stream training.
-	Contribution: Propose a new task and provide a novel method to solve this problem.
-	Product: A 2023SigKDD submitted paper, 1st author.

### `Internet Comments (nudge)’s Influence on Individuals’ High-level Thinking`

- Timeline: May-Sept 2022
- Institution: CSC Lab, UC Davis
- Instructor: [prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/)
-	Motivation: Investigate if peers' thinking comments can help nudge individuals on higher-order thinking processes.
-	Method: Complete user experiments on the well-designed prototypes based on our assumptions.
-	Role: Implement the Deep Thinking Map prototype based on the Concept Map developed in our lab; help organize pilot experiments; literature surveying


### Machine Learning-Based Volatility Prediction

- Timeline: Mar 2022 - Mar 2023
- Institution: School of Economics, ZJU
- Instructor: [prof. Xingguo Luo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xingguo)
-	Motivation: Investigate if CV methods can help extract image signals for pricing options and predict the volatility of assets.
-	Method: Construct multi-modal data based on datasets from markets of derivates and that of their underlying assets; Use CNN as the encoder to extract image signals and utilize the representations to predict the volatility.
-	Contribution: First introduce CNN methods to solve the volatility predicting problem; Introduce multi-modal concepts to the Machine Learning of the Asset Pricing domain.
-	Product: A working paper, 1st author.


### `Machine Learning-Based Model for Financial Distress Prediction`

- Timeline: May 2021- May 2022
- Institution: School of Management, ZJU
- Instructor: [prof. Xingguo Luo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/dongwang)
-	Motivation: Investigate if using deep learning with raw financial data will help predict financial distress.
-	Method: Compare the performances of different algorithms with different types of data.
-	Role: Paper writing; literature surveying; designing experiments.
 

### `Spatio-temporal Data Compression`

- Timeline: Jul-Sept 2021
- Institution: Center of Data Science, ZJU
-	Motivation: Solve the spatiotemporal data compression problem with the techniques for graph evolution.
-	Method: Combine a particle-swarm-optimization-based graph clustering algorithm and a compression algorithm (a well-designed data structure ) for dynamic-evolution spatiotemporal data.
-	Role: reproduce two baseline papers with C++ codes and run several large-scale datasets to conduct the case study.
